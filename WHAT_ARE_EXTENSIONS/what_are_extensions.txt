WHAT ARE EXTENSIONS

Extensions are small software programs that customize the browsing experience.
They enable user to tailor Chrome functionality ane behavior to individual needs or preferences.
They are built on web technoligies such as HTML, Javascript and CSS.

An extension must fullfill a single purpose that is narrow defined and easy to understand.
A single extension can include multiple components and a range of functionality,
as long as everything contributes towards a common purpose.

User interfaces should be minimal and have intent.
They can range from a single icon, such as the Google Mail Checker extension
show on the right, overring an entire page.

Extensions files are zipped into a single .crx package that the user download and install.
This means extension do not depend on content from the web, inlike ordinary web apps.

Extensions are distributed through Chrome Developer Dashboard and published to Chrome Web Store.
For more information, see the store developer documentation.
