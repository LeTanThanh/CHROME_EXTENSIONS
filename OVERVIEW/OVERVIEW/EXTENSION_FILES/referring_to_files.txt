REFERRING TO FILES

An extension's files can be referred to by using a relative URL,
just as file in an ordinary HTML page.
<img src="images/my_image.png">

Addtionally. each file can also be accesses using an absoluted URL.
chrome-extension://<extensionID>/<pathToFile>

In the absolute URL, the <extensionID> is a unique identifier that the extension system generates for each extension.
The IDs for all loaded extensions can be view by going to the URL chrome://extensions.
The <pathToFile> is the location of the file under the extension's top folder.
It matches the relative URL.

While working on an unpacked extension the extension ID can change.
Speficifically, the ID of an unpacked extension will change of the extension is loaded from a different directory;
the ID will change again when the extension is packaged.
If the extension's core relies on an absoluted URL,
it can use the chrome.runtime.getURL() method to avoid hardcoding the ID during development.
