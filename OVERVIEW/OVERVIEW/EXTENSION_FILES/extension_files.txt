EXTENSION FILES

Extensions vary in types of files and amount of directories, but they are all require to have a manifest.
Some basic, but useful, extension may consist of just the manifest and its toolbar icon.

The manifest file, titled manifest.json, gives the browser information about the extension,
such as most important files and capabilities the extension might use.
