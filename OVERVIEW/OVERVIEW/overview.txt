OVERVIEW

Extensions are zipped bundles of HTML, CSS, Javascript, images, and other files used in the web platform
that customize the GoogleChrome browsing experience.
Extensions are built using web technology and can use the same APIs the browser provides to the open web.

Extensions have a wide range of functional possibilities.
They can modify web content users see and interact with or extend and change the behavior of the browser itself.

Consider extensions the gateway to making the Chrome browser the most personalized browser.
