ACTIVE THE EXTENSION ON ALL PAGES

Use a "browser_action" when an extension's feature are functional in most situations.

REGISTER BROWSER ACTION

The "browser_action" field is registered in the manifest.

{
  "name": "My Awesome browser_action Extension",
  ...
  "browser_action": {

  },
  ...
}

Declaring "browser_action" keeps the icon colorized, indicating the extension is available to users.

ADD A BADGE

Badges display a colored banner with up to four characters on top the browser icon.
They can only be used by extensions that declare "browser_action" in their manifest.

Use badges to indicate the state of your extension.
The Drine Water Event sample displays a badge with "ON" to show the user they successfully set an alarm
and displays nothing when the extension is idle.

Set the text of the badge by calling chrome.browserAction.setBadgeText
and the banner color by calling chrome.browserAction.setBadge.BackgroundColor

chrome.browserAction.setBadgeText({text: 'ON'});
chrome.browserAction.setBadgeBackgroundColor({color: '#4688F1'});
