PROVIDE THE EXTENSION ICONS

Extensions require at least one icon to represent it. Provide icons in PNG format form the best visual results,
although any format supported by WebKit including BMP, GIF and JPEG is accepted.

DESIGNATE TOOLBAR ICON

Icons specific to the toolbar are registered in the "default_icon" field under "browser_action" or "page_action" in the manifest. 
Including multiple sizes is encouraged to scale for the 16-dip space.
At minimum, 16x16 and 32x32 sizes are recommended.

{
  "name": "My Awesome page_action Extension",
  ...
  "page_action": {
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "extension_toolbar_icon16.png",
      "32": "extension_toolbar_icon32.png"
    }
  },
  ...
}

All icons should be square or they may be distorted.
If no icons are supplied, Chrome will add a generic one to the toolbar.
