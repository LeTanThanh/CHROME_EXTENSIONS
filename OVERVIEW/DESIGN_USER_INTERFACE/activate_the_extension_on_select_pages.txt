ACTIVE THE EXTENSION ON SELECT PAGES

Use "page_action" when an extension's features are only available under define circumstances/

DECLARE PAGE ACTION

The "page_action" field is registered in the manifest

{
  "name": "My Awesome page_action Extension",
  ...
  "page_action": {
    ...
  },
  ...
}

Declaring "page_action" will colorize the icon only when the extension is available to user,
otherwise it will be displayed in greyscale

DEFINE RULES FOR ACTIVATING THE EXTENSION

Define rules for when the extension is usable by calling chrome.declaretiveContent
under the runtime.onInstalled listener is a background script.
The Page action by URL sample extension sets a condition that the url mist include a 'g'.
If the condition is met, the extension calls declarativeContent.ShowPageAction()

chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(function() {
  // Replace all rules ...
  chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.removeRules(undefined, function() {
    // With a new rule ...
    chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.addRules([
      {
        // That fires when a page's URL contains a 'g' ...
        conditions: [
          new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
            pageUrl: {urlContains: 'g'}
          })
        ],
        actions: [new chrome.declarativeContent.showPageAction()]
      }
    ]);
  });
});

ENABLE OR DISABLE THE EXTENSION

Extensions using "page_action" can activate and disabled dynamically by calling pageAction.show and pageAction.hide

The Mappy sample extension scans a web page for an address and shows its location on s static map in the pop up.
Because the extension is dependent on page content, it cannot declare rules to predict which oages will be relevant.
Instead, if an adress is found on a page it calls pageAction.show to colorize the icon and signal the extension is usable in that tab.

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(req, sender) {
  chrome.storage.local.set({'address': req.address});
  chrome.pageAction.show(sender.tab.id);
  chrome.pageAction.setTitle({tabId: sender.tab.id, title: req.address});
});
