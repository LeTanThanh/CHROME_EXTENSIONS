CREATE THE MANIFEST

Extensions start with their manifest.
Create a file called manifest.json and include the followiing code.
{
  "name": "Getting Started",
  "description": "Build an extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "manifest_version": 2
}

The directory holding the manifest file can be added as an extension in developer mode in its current state.
1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.
  - The Extension Management page can also be open ed by clicking on the Chrome menu,
  hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
3. Click the LOADED UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.

Ta-da! The extension has been successully installed.
Because no icons were included in the manifest, a generic tollbar icon will be created for the extension.
